"""Structura's command line.

Everything the program does without a window: reading the arguments and building
a pack from them. Nothing here imports the
interface, and nothing here decides what to do when no build is asked for --
`main` reports that back and lets the caller answer it, because the two entry
points answer it differently. The build that carries the window opens one; the
command line build says it has none.

That split is what lets one executable be both. `structura.py` is the dual use
entry point: run it with arguments and it builds a pack in the terminal, run it
with none and the window opens. `cli/__main__.py` is the same command line with
the interface left out of the bundle entirely.
