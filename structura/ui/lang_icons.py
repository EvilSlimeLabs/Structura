"""Round language badges carrying a language code.

A flag is a country, and a country is not a language: Spanish is not Spain,
English is not England, and picking one flag per language tells a good part of
the world their language belongs to somebody else. The picker therefore labels
each language with its code on a disc, with the language's own name alongside.

The disc is coloured from `lookups/language_colors.json`, which is
AnandChowdhary/language-icons' colours.json with three additions: an entry for
each constructed language, one for Cebuano, which the upstream file does not
carry, and a `default` for anything unlisted. A language may name one, two or
three colours and the disc is divided into that many equal diagonal bands, so
one fills it, two split it along the diagonal, and three take a third each.

Drawn here rather than shipped as art so a badge comes out at whatever size and
scaling the window is running at, and in the bundled typeface rather than
whichever one the machine happens to have.

One badge is borrowed: upside-down English wears the English badge turned over.
