"""The Structura window.

Built on CustomTkinter, which is tkinter underneath, so the frozen build stays
the size it was while drawing modern widgets and following the desktop's own
light or dark setting.

The window is one screen with no modes to hunt through. Structures stack on the
left, everything that describes the pack sits on the right, and the status line
along the bottom says what the program is doing at all times. There is no basic
and advanced split: a single structure simply does not need a name tag, and the
second one added asks for both.

Nothing here reaches into structura_core beyond its public calls, so the same
work can be driven from the command line or from another front end.
