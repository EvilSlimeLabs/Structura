"""The interface's typeface, shipped with the program rather than borrowed.

Left to itself Tk picks the platform's UI font, which is Segoe UI on Windows and
something else everywhere else, so the window reads differently on every machine
and the language badges are drawn in a face the program has no right to
redistribute. Source Sans Pro travels with the program instead, under the SIL
Open Font License 1.1. See fonts/LICENSE.txt, which ships beside the fonts.

On Windows a font can be handed to the process privately, without installing it
for the whole machine, which is what AddFontResourceEx with FR_PRIVATE does.
Elsewhere there is no equivalent that Tk will see, so the window falls back to
the platform's own UI font; the badges still use the bundled file directly,
because PIL loads a .ttf by path and does not care whether it is installed.

Chinese and other scripts Source Sans Pro does not cover fall through to the
system font, which is what Tk does for a missing glyph anyway.
