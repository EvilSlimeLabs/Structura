"""Fold the Bedrock Technical Resource Pack into a generated Structura pack.

Both packs replace `entity/armor_stand.entity.json`, and a client entity file in
a resource pack **replaces** the vanilla one rather than merging with it. Between
two packs only the higher one in the player's list is read at all, so running
Structura and TechPack side by side silently loses whichever sits lower: either
the ghost blocks stop appearing, or every TechPack visualisation does. There is
no ordering that gives both.

Bundling is the way out. The two entity descriptions are merged into one file
and TechPack's supporting assets are copied in beside Structura's, so a single
pack drives both sets of features and the ordering question disappears. The
player then loads only the generated pack; keeping the standalone TechPack
applied as well re-creates the conflict.

The submodule is reference material at rest, so nothing here runs unless the
caller asks for it. When TechPack's assets are absent, as in a checkout without
submodules, `available()` is False and the setting has nothing to offer.
