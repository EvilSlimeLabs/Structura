"""Reads the interface's translations, one file per language.

`lookups/lang/` holds a `.lang` file per language, named for its **locale** the
way Minecraft names its own: a language and a region, `en_US.lang`, `es_MX.lang`,
`zh_CN.lang`. A file is one `key=value` per line, in UTF-8, with `#` for a
comment.

The file's name is the whole of a language's identity. It is the key every table
is read with, the value the picker carries, and what the settings file
remembers, and nothing inside the file repeats it: a locale written in two
places is a locale that can disagree with itself.

The language part is what a locale falls back to. `zh_TW` and `zh_CN` are drawn
in the same face and the same colours without either being listed, because
`ui_fonts` and `lang_icons` ask for the locale first and the language second.
That is what makes adding Mexican Spanish beside Spain's a matter of adding a
file: it inherits everything Spanish, and needs saying only where it differs.

Two keys describe the language rather than label anything. `language name` is
its own name for itself, which is what the picker shows and sorts by. `language
badge` is the two or three letters the badge carries, for the languages where
the language part is not the thing to show: the badge for `en_PT` is PT, because
Pirate Speak reading EN says nothing. Neither is a string the window draws,
which is why the tests that compare one language against another leave them out.
