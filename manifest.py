## Deriving it from the pack *name* alone meant a rebuild produced an identical
## UUID and an identical version -- the version is the Structura version -- so
## the game refused the import as a duplicate instead of updating anything.
## Random UUIDs fixed that but made every export a brand new pack, so rebuilds
## piled up in the player's list.
##
## Hashing the content gets both: the structure files, the name, the icon, the
## description, the transparency, the offsets and the toggles all go in. Build
## the same pack twice and it is the same pack, with the same UUID, which is
## honest. Change any of it and the UUID moves, so the import is an addition
## rather than a clash.
