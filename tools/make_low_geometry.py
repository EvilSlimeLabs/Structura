"""Generate the simplified form of every shape family that carries a lot of cubes.

    python tools/make_low_geometry.py

Structura draws each ghost block as real geometry, and Vibrant Visuals lights
every one of those shapes. A build made of blocks that each cost half a dozen
cubes is therefore markedly more expensive to display than one made of plain
cubes, which is what the low geometry setting is for.

A family's simpler form is named after it with a suffix, `bell__low` beside
`bell`, and is the box the detailed shape fits inside: one cube, textured with
the window that box covers on the tile. `armor_stand_geo_class` picks it up
automatically when a pack is built with low geometry, and a family with no such
form is drawn exactly as it always is. That is most of them, since a block that
is already a cube has nothing to simplify.

The forms are written into `lookups/block_shapes.json` and `lookups/block_uv.json`
beside the shapes they came from, so nothing here is needed at run time. Re-run
it after changing a detailed shape.
