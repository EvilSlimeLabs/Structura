"""Dye the banner sheet, once per colour, so a banner is drawn in its own.

    python tools/make_banner_textures.py

A banner's colour is not in its block states. It is in the block entity beside
the block, as `Base`, a number from 0 to 15 in the same order as wool, and the
game draws it by tinting one white sheet at run time. A ghost block cannot tint
anything, so the tinting is done here instead: sixteen copies of
`banner_base.tga`, each multiplied by its dye, written into the vanilla pack as
`textures/entity/banner/banner_<colour>.png`.

The dyes are read out of the pack's own wool textures rather than written down
here, so they are the colours this pack actually uses.

**Patterns are not drawn.** A banner may carry six of them, each with a colour
of its own, which is more combinations than could ever be written to disk: they
would have to be composited while a pack is built, and the texture atlas takes
files rather than pictures. What is here is the base colour.

Re-run `tools/make_container_forms.py` after this if the list of colours
changes. Nothing here is needed at run time.

# --- the two banners that are not a colour -----------------------------------
#
# An ominous banner is not a dye. It is a banner the game draws from a sheet of
# its own, and the pack the submodule carries has that sheet already: it is
# copied in rather than drawn. A banner carrying patterns is the other case,
# and there is nothing to copy, so it gets a mark of this project's own: the
# Evil Slime Labs logo the About window opens, over a black cloth.
#
# **A design is bigger than a tile, so it is written where a grid of tiles can
# read it.** Only sixteen by sixteen of a texture becomes a tile and a quad
# reads one tile, so a cloth showing a design is drawn as a grid of quads
# instead of as one, and the design is written at the size that grid reads:
# thirty two across by sixty four down, which is the cloth's own proportions and
# more than the twenty by forty vanilla draws it at.
#
# It goes below the sheet rather than in it. Both marked sheets keep vanilla's
# 64 by 64 layout in their top half, so the post and the bar are read by the
# same windows as every other banner's, and carry the design under it.
