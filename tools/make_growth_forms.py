"""Give a block the form and the face it has at each stage of its life.

    python tools/make_growth_forms.py

A crop is not one block. Wheat has eight textures, one per stage of growth, and
a lookup that names only the last of them draws a field of seedlings as a field
ready to harvest. The same is true of a cocoa pod, which changes size as well as
texture, of a sweet berry bush, of a turtle egg clutch, and of a composter,
which fills up.

Each of these is written here as a family of its own with one variant per state
value, because the shared `cross_texture` family cannot carry them: a variant
named "3" on that family would answer for every cross shaped block in the game
that happened to be in state 3.

The stage textures are named directly rather than through `terrain_texture.json`,
which mostly has no entry for them: `wheat_stage_0` is a file in the pack and
nothing points at it. A literal path in an `overwrite` is read as given.

Nothing here is needed at run time. Re-run `tools/make_low_geometry.py`
afterwards if any of these gains a third cube.
