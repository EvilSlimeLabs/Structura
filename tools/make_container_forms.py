"""Give shulker boxes and banners the shape and the sheet they really have.

    python tools/make_container_forms.py

A shulker box was a cube wearing its lid texture on all six faces, because the
only thing `blocks.json` names for it is `shulker_top_<colour>`. It is really a
base with a lid on top, and the whole box is one entity sheet, 64x64 per colour.
Each colour is a family of its own: the sheet is the only thing that tells them
apart, and one family cannot carry seventeen of them.

A banner was `ignore`, so it was not drawn at all. It is a cloth hanging from a
pole, and both are on one sheet. Standing banners turn in sixteen steps like a
sign; wall banners hang off the block behind them.

The sheets are copied out of the community submodule into `textures/entity/`.
Only the top left 16x16 of a texture becomes a tile, so every face names the
window it reads.

**A banner is drawn in its colour but without its patterns.** The colour is in
the block entity, as `Base`, and `tools/make_banner_textures.py` dyes the sheet
once per colour so that each has a texture to read: vanilla tints one white
sheet at run time and a ghost block cannot tint. Patterns are a different
matter. A banner may carry six, each with a colour of its own, which is more
combinations than could be written to disk, so they would have to be composited
while a pack is built and handed to the atlas as a picture rather than a file.

Nothing here is needed at run time. Re-run `tools/make_low_geometry.py`
afterwards.
