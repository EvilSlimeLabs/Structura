"""Give the blocks that are furniture a shape worth the name.

    python tools/make_furniture_forms.py

A lectern is a stand with a sloped desk on it, an enchanting table is a slab
with a book floating above, a bed is a mattress on legs and a conduit is a small
cage hanging in the middle of its block. Drawn as full cubes, which is what a
lookup with one entry gives them, they read as stone blocks in a row and say
nothing about what they are.

These also carry the states that change what they look like. A bed is two
blocks, head and foot, and the two are not the same shape or the same texture. A
conduit is open when it is powered and closed when it is not. A daylight
detector has a second block id for its inverted form, with a top of its own.

Nothing here is needed at run time. Re-run `tools/make_low_geometry.py`
afterwards: most of these have more than two cubes and want a simple form.

# --- beds -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Two blocks, head and foot, each a mattress on two legs. Bedrock tells the
# halves apart with `head_piece_bit`, which arrives as the shape variant.
#
# **A bed lies along x, with its head at x16.** The tiles say so: on
# `bed_head_top` and `bed_head_side` the pillow is the right half of the
# picture, and on `bed_head_side` the leg is the last three pixels of it, so the
# picture runs foot to head across its own width. A face's window runs along x
# on the top and along the block's own axis on the sides, so a bed lying along z
# has its pillow painted down one side of the mattress instead of across the
# head of it.
#
# **Two legs a block, not four.** `bed_feet_end` carries a leg at each corner,
# which is one end of the bed seen from outside, and `bed_feet_side` carries one,
# at the foot. Four to a block puts eight under a bed.
#
# The legs are drawn from the bed's own tile too, off the three by three patch
# under the mattress, rather than from planks.

# **The leg is drawn at the end of the tile the leg is at.** `bed_feet_side`
# carries it in the first three pixels and `bed_head_side` in the last three,
# because each picture runs foot to head. Both halves read the foot tile's
# corner, so the head's legs came out blank.
#
# **And one long side has to read its picture the other way round.** The two
# faces of a box opposite each other run their windows in opposite directions,
# so the pillow ends up at the head on one and at the foot on the other. A
# window that starts at the far edge and runs back is how Bedrock reads a
# picture mirrored.
