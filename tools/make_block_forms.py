"""Give a block a shape it cannot be read off a terrain tile with.

    python tools/make_block_forms.py

Several families take more than one form, and the difference between the forms
is the
part that holds them up rather than the part everyone looks at. A bell is the
same bell whether it hangs from a beam between two stone posts, from a beam out
of one wall, from a beam spanning two walls, or straight from the block above;
what changes is what carries it. The same is true of a grindstone's legs and of
a hanging sign's chains, and none of it is in the block's own texture: the shape
has to say it.

This writes those forms out. Each variant is a different list of cubes rather
than the same list moved, so the mountings read as different objects.

A campfire also carries its fire here. `extinguished` is the only thing telling
a lit campfire from a dead one, and the logs alone barely differ, so the lit
form gets two crossed quads of the flame texture. That is also what tells a soul
campfire from an ordinary one, because `@up` resolves to whichever fire the
block declares.

The shelf is here for the other reason a block cannot be read off a terrain
tile: its texture is a sheet with a different picture for each face, and taking
the whole of it paints the front's compartments onto all six. A door is the
narrow version of the same thing: three pixels thick, and every one of its six
faces was reading the whole of the door's picture, so the panel was squeezed
into each edge.

The tripwire hook is here for a third reason: `attached_bit` says whether
anything is tied to it, and the hook hanging loose off its plate is a different
arrangement of the same three pieces from the hook held out level by a wire.

The shelf, the sculk shrieker and string are here for a fourth: a ghost block is
half transparent, and vanilla's own way of drawing them does not survive that. A
shelf's compartments are painted into its front texture, which reads as a shelf
on a solid block and as a plain box on a see-through one, so they are cut here
instead. A shrieker is half a block tall with a hole in the middle of its lid,
and drawn from the terrain tiles as a full cube it is a block of sculk with a
transparent top. String lies flat rather than filling its block, and wears a
tile `tools/make_string_texture.py` draws for it. A flower pot is hollow, and
one cube of the compost tile is a brown block with nothing pot shaped about it.

The brewing stand, the bell and the heavy core are here for the same reason from
the other end: their tiles hold more than the part any one face wants. A brewing
stand's rod is drawn down the middle of its tile with the arms that hold the
bottles either side of it, the bell is an eight by nine picture in a sixteen by
sixteen file, the heavy core's file holds three eight by eight pictures and an
empty quarter, and every one of a dried ghast's twenty four textures is a ten by
ten picture in a sixteen by sixteen file. A face taking the whole tile wears the
wrong thing or nothing at all.

Both pots are here for a fifth reason as well: what look like their terrain
tiles are sheets. A face left to work its own window out reads the whole of one
as if it were a single picture, which puts the decorated pot's shoulder on the
unwrap of its neck and takes the flower pot's wall from the rim. `on_sheet`
turns a region of a sheet into the reference and the window a face needs.

The families here own their entries in `lookups/block_shapes.json` and
`lookups/block_uv.json` outright: re-running this replaces them. Nothing here is
needed at run time. Re-run `tools/make_low_geometry.py` afterwards, or the
simplified forms still outline the old shapes.

# down off the plate with nothing on it, or held out horizontally by the wire it
# is tied to. That is a different arrangement of the same three pieces rather
# than one shape turned, so each gets its own list.
#
# It hangs on the wall behind it, so the plate sits at z 0 to 2, the same way a
# wall sign does, and the hook reaches out towards +z.
#
# `blocks.json` gives the block three textures and the pieces take two of them:
# `@down` is trip_wire_base, which is oak planks, and `@north` is
# trip_wire_source, which holds the hook drawn face on. That tile is the hook at
# rest: the ring across x5 to x11 at the top, and the shaft hanging below it
# down the middle, which is where the windows below read from.
#
# The plate is four across, two deep and eight tall, flat on the wall. The shaft
# is the two by seven strip below the ring on the tile, at its own scale, and
# runs out of the plate at an angle. The hook is the ring, six by six on the
# tile, drawn four across so that it reads the width of the plate, and it hangs
# square across the end of the shaft.
#
# Three arrangements, from `attached_bit` and `powered_bit`:
#
#   nothing on it   the shaft points up out of the wall at 45 degrees and the
#                   hook hangs off the low half of its end
#   tied to a wire  the wire pulls the shaft down to near the horizontal and the
#                   hook comes with it
#   engaged         the shaft drops to 45 degrees the other way and the hook

# floor, so it stood two pixels proud of the block.
#
# `brewing_stand` draws the rod down the middle of its tile with the arms that
# hold the bottles either side of it, so a face taking the whole tile wears the
# arms as well. The rod names the two pixel column it wants.
#
# **The plates are placed from the sockets on the base tile.** Bedrock ships no
# model for this block and `brewing_stand_base` is opaque across the whole tile,
# so the only thing in the pack that says where one plate ends and the next
# begins is the three bottle sockets drawn on it, at (3.5, 3.5), (3.5, 11.5) and
# (12, 7.5). Each plate is the part of the tile its socket sits in the middle of.
