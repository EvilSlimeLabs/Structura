"""Regenerate the window screenshots used by the README.

Screenshots of a program's own interface go stale the moment the interface
changes, and a stale screenshot is worse than none: it teaches a layout that is
not there any more. These are taken from the running window instead of by
hand, so a UI change plus one command brings the documentation back in step.

    python tools/make_screenshots.py

Writes into docs/. Needs a desktop session: the window is really opened, raised
and photographed, so this cannot run headless. The in-game screenshots beside
these are the ones only a person in a world can take.

It photographs a rectangle of the screen, which means anything that comes to the
front during the run lands in the documentation instead of the program. Every
grab therefore checks that the foreground window still belongs to this process
and refuses to save if it does not. A missing screenshot is recoverable; a
committed picture of somebody's browser is not. Leave the machine alone while it
runs.
