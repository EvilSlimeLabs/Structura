"""Put the right texture on each part of the blocks built from several cubes.

    python tools/fix_problem_blocks.py

A block made of one cube can take the six textures Bedrock declares for it and
be right. A block made of several cannot, because every cube gets the same six,
so a beacon's glass shell, its core and its obsidian base are all painted alike.

`block_uv.json` has an `overwrite` list for exactly this, a texture per cube per
face. A value written `@up` or `@down` means "whatever this block declares for
that face", so one entry serves every wood a block comes in and every state it
has, without naming a single texture file.

The families whose forms differ by how they are mounted are written by
`tools/make_block_forms.py` instead, which owns their shapes as well as their
textures. Nothing here is needed at run time; it edits the lookup tables in
place.
