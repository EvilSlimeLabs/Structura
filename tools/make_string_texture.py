"""Draw a string a ghost block can actually be seen with.

    python tools/make_string_texture.py

Vanilla's `trip_wire` tile is a scatter of faint single pixels across a quarter
of the tile, because the game draws string as a thin quad turned to face the way
the wire runs and lit at full brightness. A ghost block is neither: it is a
half-transparent plate lying flat in its block, drawn against whatever is behind
it, and vanilla's scatter on that plate is invisible from more than a couple of
blocks away.

So the tile is drawn here instead: a cross of solid lines through the middle of
the tile, in the colours vanilla's own string is drawn in, written into the
vanilla pack as `textures/blocks/structura_string.png`.

**A cross, because the direction is not in the block.** Bedrock's `trip_wire`
carries `attached_bit`, `disarmed_bit`, `powered_bit` and `suspended_bit` and
nothing that says which way the wire runs; the game works that out from the
blocks beside it as it draws. A structure file cannot say, so a single line
would be pointing the wrong way about half the time and a cross is right about
where the string is either way. `redstone_dust_cross` is the same answer to the
same problem.

Nothing here is needed at run time.
