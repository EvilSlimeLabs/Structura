"""Copy the part of TechPack a generated pack needs into the package.

    python tools/stage_tech_pack.py

`be_tech_pack/` is a git submodule and a whole add-on repository, seventy
megabytes of it, most of that source art and history. A generated pack draws on
about a megabyte, and that megabyte has to live *inside* `structura/` for the
same reason the lookup tables do. Setuptools ships package data only from under
the package directory, so a `pip install` of a project keeping it outside
installs a program that cannot offer the TechPack setting at all.

The subset is therefore staged into `structura/techpack/` and committed. The
submodule stays the source of truth, so re-run this after updating it.
`tests/test_tech_pack.py` fails if the two have drifted.
