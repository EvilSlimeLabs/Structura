"""Build the font files Structura ships.

Two of them cannot simply be copied in.

**The CJK face.** Noto Sans SC is 17 MB because it carries every character in
Simplified Chinese. The window needs the few hundred that appear in its own
translations, so it is subset down to exactly those -- a hundredth of the size,
for a file that renders every string the program can display. Re-run this after
adding or changing a Chinese translation, or the new characters will be missing.

**The enchanting face.** Minecraft's enchanting table script is a font, not a
set of characters: there is no Unicode block for it, so no string can be the
real thing. The glyphs live in the resource pack as a bitmap sheet, and this
traces them into outlines and assembles a TTF, mapping each Latin letter to the
rune that stands for it. That makes the Enchanting language genuinely readable
by substitution, the way the alphabet is meant to be.

    python tools/make_fonts.py

Needs fonttools, and for the CJK subset a copy of Noto Sans SC to subset from.
