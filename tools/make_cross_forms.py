"""Give the blocks that are drawn as an X the X, and the right picture on it.

    python tools/make_cross_forms.py

Some blocks are not boxes at all. Fire is a sheet of flame the game hangs on
whatever is burning, and a pointed dripstone or a sulfur spike is a spike that
tapers to nothing. Drawn as a cube, which is what a lookup with one entry gives
them, fire is a solid block of flame and a spike is a stone box.

They are drawn here the way the pack draws a plant: two quads crossing at right
angles, so there is something to see from every side and nothing solid.

**A spike's picture is in its states, and the tables were reading its faces
instead.** `blocks.json` gives `pointed_dripstone` six textures -- tip, frustum,
middle, base and merge -- and hangs them on six texture slots. Those are slots
the engine picks from for a model of its own, not faces, so a block taking them
literally wears five different pictures at once and a different five depending
on which way it is looked at. Which one it should wear is `dripstone_thickness`,
and whether it points up or down is `hanging`; both are states, and both are in
the file name of the picture the pack already ships. So each form names its
texture outright.

A sulfur spike is the same block with a different quarry: the same two states,
the same five thicknesses, and its own ten pictures. Its merge is filed as
`tip_merge` and everything else matches.

Nothing here is needed at run time. Re-run `tools/make_low_geometry.py`
afterwards.
