"""Give the mob heads a shape, so that they are drawn at all.

    python tools/make_head_forms.py

A head was `ignore`, which is the lookup for a block Structura leaves out on
purpose, so every skull in a build simply was not there and nothing said so.

Seven heads are built here: the skeleton, the wither skeleton, the zombie, the
creeper, the player, the piglin and the ender dragon. Each is a family of its
own, because the sheet it wears is the only thing that tells them apart and
`blocks.json` gives every one of them the same name for it, `skull`, which the
vanilla pack points at soul sand.

**The shapes come from the game's own entity geometry.** The community submodule
ships `models/entity/*.geo.json`, so a piglin's snout, its tusks and its ears,
and every one of the dragon's seven pieces, are the cubes and the UV corners
Mojang drew rather than something measured off a picture. `convert()` turns one
of those cubes into a Structura cube: it lays out the six faces the way Bedrock
unwraps a box, and turns the model half a turn about its own middle, because an
entity faces -z and a block faces +z.

The four skulls and the player have no geometry file, being drawn by the engine
rather than by a model, so they take the head box every humanoid skin has in the
top left corner of its sheet.

Only the top left 16x16 of a texture becomes a tile, so each face names the
window it reads. The sheets are copied out of the community submodule into
`textures/entity/`.

Nothing here is needed at run time.
