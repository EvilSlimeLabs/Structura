"""Generate the chiseled bookshelf's sixty-four filled states.

    python tools/make_bookshelf.py

A chiseled bookshelf has six slots and remembers which of them hold a book, in a
`books_stored` state that is a six bit number, so there are sixty-four ways it
can look. Vanilla draws the shelf itself from `chiseled_bookshelf_empty` and lays
`chiseled_bookshelf_occupied` over the slots that are filled, and that is what
this builds: one variant per value, the shelf plus a small panel over each
occupied slot.

The slot grid is measured from the two textures rather than guessed, because the
pixels where they differ are exactly the six book faces. It comes out as three
columns four pixels wide at x 1, 6 and 11, and two rows six pixels tall at y 1
and 9.

The front is the **south** face, at `z` 16, because a block at rest faces south
and that is where the rotation tables put `direction` 0. The books stand proud
of it. Put on the north face instead, the shelf reads its books out of the wall
it is against and every one of its four facings is half a turn out.

`blocks.json` names the front texture `chiseled_bookshelf_front` and the back
`chiseled_bookshelf_side`, but both are drawn from the empty shelf here rather
than taken from those names: `chiseled_bookshelf_front` resolves through
`terrain_texture.json` to the empty shelf, which would put a shelf front on the
back of the block as well, so the back names the side texture outright.

Writes into `lookups/block_shapes.json` and `lookups/block_uv.json`; nothing here
is needed at run time.
