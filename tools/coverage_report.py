"""What Structura silently drops when it builds the bundled test structures.

test_structures/ is the regression suite: between them the files name several
hundred distinct block ids across every shape family, so a lookup change that
breaks a family shows up here as blocks moving into the skipped list.

    python tools/coverage_report.py                 build everything, report
    python tools/coverage_report.py --verbose        name the structures too
    python tools/coverage_report.py --limit 20       first 20 structures only

This drives the real pipeline rather than reimplementing it, so the block states
are translated exactly as a user's build would translate them and the answer is
whatever `get_skipped()` says. A block that fails to resolve is not an error:
`make_block` raises, `_add_blocks_to_geo` catches it, and the block is recorded
as unsupported -- which is why a missing lookup entry produces a quietly
incomplete model instead of a crash, and why this report is the only place it
becomes visible.

Nothing is written outside the temporary build directories, which are removed
on the way out.
