"""Recolour the bed's six tiles, once per dye, so a bed is its own colour.

    python tools/make_bed_textures.py

A bed's colour is not in its block states. It is in the block entity beside the
block, and the game holds one model per colour rather than tinting anything, so
there is nothing for a ghost block to tint at run time. The pack carries the red
bed's six terrain tiles and nothing else, so the sixteen sets are made here:
`bed_<colour>_<part>_<face>.png` beside the originals.

**Only the blanket is recoloured.** A bed tile carries three things: the blanket,
the white sheet at the head, and the wooden legs under it. The blanket is the
only strongly red part, so a pixel is taken for blanket when its red is at least
twice its green and twice its blue, which leaves the sheet and the legs alone.

**It is a recolour, not a tint.** The tiles are red to begin with, so multiplying
them by a dye gives mud. Each blanket pixel keeps how bright it is against a
blanket pixel of ordinary brightness in its own tile, and that fraction of the
dye is what it becomes.

The dyes are read out of the pack's own wool textures, the same way
`tools/make_banner_textures.py` reads them, so they are the colours this pack
actually uses. Nothing here is needed at run time; re-run
`tools/make_furniture_forms.py` afterwards if the list of colours changes.
