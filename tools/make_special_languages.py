"""Write the special languages out as ordinary language files.

    python tools/make_special_languages.py

Pirate Speak, LOLCAT, Shakespearean and upside-down English are English put
through a transform, and Enchanting is English left alone and rendered in the
rune face. The program reads all five as language files like any other, which is
what makes adding a language nothing more than adding a file. Writing them by
hand would mean sixty-odd strings times five to keep in step with every label
anyone adds, so they are generated from `en_US.lang` and committed.

**Re-run this after changing an English string**, or the special languages still
say the old one. `tests/test_languages.py` fails when they have drifted.

The transforms themselves are in `tools/lang_fun.py`.
