"""Build the copper golem statue from the models the game draws it with.

    python tools/make_statue_poses.py

A copper golem statue does not record its pose in a block state. It keeps it in
the block entity beside the block, the way a sign keeps its text, so a structure
holding four statues in four poses has a single palette entry for all of them and
the pose has to be read from `block_position_data`. `structure_reader` reads that
now and `structura.core` turns the `Pose` field into the shape variant, which is
what this table answers.

**The four poses are four geometry files**, not one shape leaned four ways. The
community submodule ships `copper_golem`, `copper_golem_sitting`,
`copper_golem_running` and `copper_golem_star`, and each is the golem's nine or
eleven cubes with the arms and the legs turned where that pose puts them. Built
from three boxes instead, the statue is a copper blob wearing terrain tiles.

The sheet is `textures/blocks/copper_golem.png`, which is a 64x64 entity sheet
rather than a tile, so every face names the corner of it that its own face was
drawn at. `terrain_texture.json` already points the block's declared name at it,
so the reference travels as `@up` and the eight oxidation stages all resolve to
the same sheet, which is what they did before.

The golem is **taller than the block it stands on**, twenty four pixels to the
top of the pompom, and is drawn at that size: shrinking it would put the ghost
somewhere the real statue will not be. The dragon head is the same case.

Writes into `lookups/block_shapes.json` and `lookups/block_uv.json`. Not needed
at run time. Re-run `tools/make_low_geometry.py` afterwards.
