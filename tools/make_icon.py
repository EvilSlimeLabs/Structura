"""Regenerate the Structura icons.

Draws a 5x5x5 isometric cube of hologram panes with the Structura S snaking
through it in yellow concrete, and writes both icons the project ships:

    lookups/pack_icon.png   256x256, over the Slime Lab background art. This is
                            the icon copied into every generated pack, where it
                            sits in Minecraft's pack list as a filled tile.
    pack_icon.ico           the desktop icon, 16 px through 256 px, on
                            transparency. A taskbar or Explorer icon is composed
                            against whatever is behind it, so it carries the
                            iconography alone -- a baked-in background would show
                            as a square tile against every theme.

The block faces are real textures out of Vanilla_Resource_Pack; only the panes
are hand authored, and they are generated here rather than stored, so the grid
colour and weight are the two numbers at the top of this file.
