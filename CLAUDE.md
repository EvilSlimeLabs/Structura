# Working on this add-on

Standing rules and the project information worth having before touching
anything. Everything here is general Bedrock add-on practice..

---

## The project

**Structura** — This tool is inspired by Litematica. It is a tool that generates Resource packs from .mcstructure files. In this resource pack the armor stands were modified to render when off screen, and have all the blocks from your structure file as bones in their model. then "ghost blocks" are used to show the user where to place the real blocks.

## Finish every round with a version bump

**Every time a set of tasks is completed, bump the version.** This is not
something to ask about or offer; it is part of finishing the work. If a round of
changes is done and the version has not moved, the round is not done.

- **Major** (`1.2.0` → `2.0.0`) — a change that breaks existing worlds, or a
  change that is so large it is not worth enumerating the minor and fix changes
  that went into it.
- **Minor** (`1.2.0` → `1.3.0`) — new behaviour a player or admin can notice: a
  new command, menu, setting, block or item, or a change to what an existing
  feature does.
- **Fix** (`1.2.0` → `1.2.1`) — refinements to what is already there: bug fixes,
  texture and model iterations, wording, layout, internal restructuring with no
  visible change in behaviour.

When a round contains both a minor and a fix, the minor bump wins and the fix digit resets to
zero. When the major digit is incremented, the minor and fix digits reset to zero.

The user will sometimes say a change "rolls into" the previous one and does not
increment the counter. That overrides the rule for that round.

### Where the version lives

The VERSION file is the source of truth. The build copies it wherever it is needed, and the release script updates it.

## Desktop Program

This project is  a python based desktop program that builds a customized compiled .mcpack file from a .mcstructure file. The release file for the project is distributed as a zip file containing the python program. The program is built using pyinstaller, and the source code is located in the `src/` folder. The program can be run from the command line or by double clicking the executable.

## Every bump ships with a summary and a commit message

Hand over both in the same reply as the bump, without being asked, at the end
after describing the work. They are written for different readers and should not
be the same sentence.

**Release summary** — one or two sentences on what is new and what changed, in
prose. Add a short clause only if something breaks an existing world and the
user has to act on it. Not a formatted document, not a section per subsystem,
not an artifact. Write it directly in the reply.

**Commit message** — one line, a few words, in the user's own log style. No
body, no bullets, no test counts. Real examples from the log:

```
First release
Bugfixes
Fixed and updated items
Revamped the compass to the ledger. More item fixes. Bracket customization.
Changed Sigil watermark in the menu
```

Brevity here is about summaries and commit messages only. Detailed technical
explanation while working through a problem is welcome.

## Choosing between stable and beta script APIs

1. **If a requirement can be met with stable APIs, it must be.** Never reach for
   a beta API out of convenience or because it is more ergonomic.
2. **If it genuinely cannot, do not silently drop the requirement.** Use a beta
   API, but pick the most established one that achieves the goal — prefer
   long-lived beta surfaces over ones that shipped very recently.

Before concluding a feature is impossible, or before choosing beta, **verify
against the real published type definitions** rather than from memory. Grep
`node_modules/@minecraft/server/index.d.ts`. The documentation site sometimes
shows examples for APIs no longer in the stable module, and enumerating a class
in the `.d.ts` has more than once turned up a method that a keyword search
missed.

## Comments describe how things work, not how they were decided

Write comments that explain mechanism, logic flow, and anything a reader needs
in order to change the code safely. **Do not** record decision history: what was
tried and rejected, what a previous version did, which bug prompted a change,
what was weighed against what. That belongs in the commit log and
`NEXT_UPDATE.md`.

Empirical facts about engine behaviour are worth keeping, stated as facts —
"the X axis runs opposite to the Z axis here" rather than "this took three
builds to work out".

Match the surrounding density: module headers carry a short orientation, exported
functions carry JSDoc with types, and inline comments explain the non-obvious.

### What an `.mcpack` actually is

A ZIP archive with the extension changed. Everything that makes one work or not
work is about the archive's shape:

- **The pack root is the archive root.** `manifest.json` must be a top-level
  entry. If the archive contains a wrapper folder — the shape you get from
  right-click → "Send to → Compressed folder" on the project directory —
  Minecraft imports it without an error and the pack never appears in the list.
- **Entry paths use forward slashes**, always, whatever the host OS. A backslash
  in an entry name is a path component to Bedrock, not a separator.
- **Directory entries are not needed** and are not emitted. Nor is anything the
  host OS wants to add: no `__MACOSX`, no `.DS_Store`, no `Thumbs.db`.
- **Classic 32-bit ZIP only.** No ZIP64, no encryption, no data descriptors.
- Compression is optional per entry. `tools/lib/zip.js` deflates, then keeps the
  stored bytes whenever deflating did not actually shrink the entry — which is
  the usual outcome for PNG.
- The build is **reproducible**: entries are sorted, timestamps are fixed, and
  `manifest.json` and `pack_icon.png` are written first. The same tree always
  produces the same bytes, so a changed `sha256` in the build output means the
  content changed.

### Bedrock is case-sensitive; Windows is not

`textures/Density` resolves to `textures/density.png` on a Windows dev machine
and resolves to nothing on Android, iOS and consoles, where it draws an
untextured surface with no error anywhere. The pack index is therefore built
from the real directory listing, in the case the files actually have on disk,
and references are matched against those strings exactly. This class of bug is
invisible locally and is the reason the check exists.

### Pack JSON is not JSON

Bedrock's parser is more permissive than `JSON.parse`, and this pack uses all of
it: `//` comments after array entries, the occasional trailing comma, raw tab
characters inside Molang string literals (`animations/chunk.json`), and a UTF-8
BOM. Read pack files through `tools/lib/jsonc.js`; never `JSON.parse` one
directly, or valid content will be reported as broken.

Parsing is for validation only. **The build copies file bytes verbatim into the
archive** — it never re-serialises a pack file. A compiler that reformatted its
input would silently drop those comments and reflow the compact arrays the model
files are kept in.

### The reference graph the audit resolves

Bedrock never reports a broken reference. A geometry that does not exist, a
texture with the wrong case, a render controller naming a short name the entity
never declared — each one loads quietly and draws nothing. Resolving them
statically is the whole point of `npm run audit`:

| Reference | Defined by |
| --- | --- |
| `geometry.*` | `models/**` — `minecraft:geometry[].description.identifier`, or a legacy `geometry.name` key |
| `animation.*` | `animations/**` — keys of `animations` |
| `controller.animation.*` | `animation_controllers/**` — keys of `animation_controllers` |
| `controller.render.*` | `render_controllers/**` — keys of `render_controllers` |
| particle identifiers | `particles/**` — `particle_effect.description.identifier` |
| material names | `materials/*.material` — the part of a `name:parent` key before the colon |
| `textures/...` | a file under `textures/`, extension resolved by the loader |

Two indirections are worth knowing because they are where the bugs hide:

- **Render controllers do not name assets.** `Geometry.foo`, `Texture.foo` and
  `Material.foo` are lookups into the *referencing entity's* `geometry`,
  `textures` and `materials` maps. The same controller can be valid for one
  entity and broken for another, so it is checked once per reference rather than
  once per file. Values that are Molang rather than a bare short name are
  skipped — they cannot be resolved without running the game.
- **`scripts.animate` entries are short names too**, keys of the entity's own
  `animations` map, not identifiers.

Identifiers the pack references but does not define — vanilla content, and
content from packs commonly loaded alongside this one — live in
`tools/external-refs.json`, where `*` is the only wildcard. Anything that
resolves to nothing and matches nothing there is an error. Adding a pattern is a
claim that something else provides that identifier, so prefer the narrowest
pattern that covers the reference.

### Replacing a vanilla client entity

`entity/player.entity.json` and `entity/armor_stand.entity.json` are copies of
vanilla's files with this pack's content added. A client entity file in a
resource pack **replaces** the vanilla one; the two do not merge. Vanilla's own
animation and render controllers keep asking for the short names vanilla's copy
declared, so every name the copy fails to carry over is a `can't find animation
<name>` in the content log and a vanilla animation that stops playing. This
drifts on its own: Mojang adds a short name in an update and the copy, which
never changed, is suddenly missing it.

`tools/vanilla-baseline.json` records what vanilla declares, and the audit warns
about the difference. Regenerate it with `node tools/refresh-baseline.js`, which
pulls the current files from `Mojang/bedrock-samples` — a manual step, since it
needs the network and is not part of `npm run release`. Run it when a Minecraft
update lands, and act on whatever the audit then reports.

It is a warning rather than an error because dropping a short name can be
deliberate — overriding these files is the whole point of the pack — and because
the baseline tracks whatever vanilla version it was last generated from, which
may be ahead of the client in hand.

### Errors and warnings

An **error** means the pack would ship broken or wrong, and the build refuses to
write an artifact: an unresolvable reference, a duplicate identifier, a file
that does not parse, a `.png` that is not a PNG, a manifest that disagrees with
`package.json`. A **warning** means something is legal but suspicious, and the
build continues: content nothing references, a `scripts.animate` name no
animation map declares, an unrecognised entry in the repository root.

### Manifest rules the build enforces

- `format_version` is `2`.
- Exactly one `resources` module. A `data`, `script` or `client_data` module, a
  `@minecraft/server` dependency, or a `script_eval` capability is an error —
  see the resource-pack-only rule above; the build is where that rule is
  actually held.
- Header and module UUIDs are well-formed and all differ from each other.
- **UUIDs are never regenerated.** The header UUID is the pack's identity: a new
  one makes every world with the pack applied treat it as a different pack and
  quietly drop the old one.
- `header.version`, `header.name` and the `header.description` prefix agree with
  `package.json`.

## Working habits

- **Isolate one variable at a time.** Changing two things and then attributing
  the result to one of them has produced wrong diagnoses here more than once.
- **Do not claim a causal link that has not been tested.** A hypothesis stated
  once becomes a fact if it is repeated; say "untested" and name the check that
  would settle it. The user tests in-game and reports back — give them the
  specific thing to look at, and say which observations would *not* prove it.
- **In-game behaviour is not knowable from here.** Rendering, placement,
  collision and font coverage need a live world.
- **Prefer Python patch scripts over shell heredocs** for multi-line source
  edits. `\n` inside a heredoc has repeatedly become a literal newline and
  corrupted JS string literals; em dashes have been mangled the same way. Write
  the script with the Write tool, or anchor on text containing neither.
- **Re-compact JSON after writing it with `json.dumps`**, which explodes short
  numeric arrays across lines. The block and model files are kept compact.

## Vanilla Resource Pack Reference

CommunityVanillaResourcePack provides a git submodule of the community maintained vanilla resource pack. It is used to provide a reference for the vanilla resource pack files, and to ensure that the add-on does not break when the vanilla resource pack is updated. When incorporating or working with the resource files in this project, it is important to ensure that the submodule is up to date and that any changes made to the resource files are compatible with the latest version of the vanilla resource pack. The submodule can be updated by running `git submodule update --remote` in the root directory of the project. Updates should be pulled in from the upstream repository to ensure that the latest changes are incorporated into the project. Any changes made to the resource files should be tested against the latest version of the vanilla resource pack to ensure compatibility and avoid breaking changes.
